# tally-dapp-integration-samples

This repo has been created to showcase integrations with the Tally wallet.

## What do I need to do?

In a nutshell tally wallet implements EIP-1193 and can be used as the standard wallet.
No extra integration effort/magic/sepcial speel is necessary.
But it's still better to show then tell, hence this repo :)

## Contributions

Feel free to open any PR/issues if you would like to see other integrations.
PRs are preffered, but you know this ... :D
