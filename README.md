# tally-dapp-integration-samples

This repo has been created to showcase integrations with the Tally wallet.

## What do I need to do?

In a nutshell tally wallet implements EIP-1193 and can be used as a standard wallet.\
No extra integration effort/magic/sepcial speel is necessary.\
But it's still better to show then tell, hence this repo :)\
\
If you are still not convinced check [this commit](https://github.com/tallycash/tally-dapp-integration-samples/commit/c254d032e02b2c0984f5b9d3cae442d41a75a207) where I update the `web3-react-simple`\
Or [this commit](https://github.com/tallycash/tally-dapp-integration-samples/commit/fe80e4d68d49268f0165c13661951880697b5bc0) to see how to update an onboard.js app
